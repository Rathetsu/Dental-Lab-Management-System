## Overview

The Dental Lab Management Mobile App is a React Native application that simplifies dental laboratory operations by digitizing key processes. Its comprehensive feature set includes appointment scheduling, inventory management, patient record keeping, real-time reporting, and enhanced communication tools.

## Technologies

Our application is built upon a carefully selected technology stack designed to enhance the performance, scalability, and maintainability of the software. Below is an outline of the key technologies used and the rationale behind their selection.

### [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) üöÄ

React Native serves as the foundation for our cross-platform mobile application. Its inherent flexibility and efficiency allow us to maintain a single, JavaScript-based codebase for both iOS and Android platforms, significantly accelerating development and simplifying maintenance. The rich ecosystem of libraries and tools it offers helps in implementing complex features efficiently.

### [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) üî•

Firebase is at the core of our authentication processes. It securely manages user authentication, allowing us to focus on application logic rather than building intricate security infrastructure. With Firebase, we ensure a seamless and secure user sign-up/sign-in experience, supporting various sign-in methods, and maintaining high levels of security.

### [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) üçÉ

We selected MongoDB as our primary database due to its flexibility and scalability. MongoDB's document-oriented structure is well-suited for storing complex and hierarchical data, which aligns perfectly with the diverse and dynamic data we deal with in the Dental Lab Management app. This enables us to iterate quickly, manage data efficiently, and scale as needed.
